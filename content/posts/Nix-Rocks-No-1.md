# NixOS is an awesome idea.

All your config in one file, more only if you want to! 

# It is not for everyone

For two reasons; It is far from finished, though you can run your own machine on it. You must still install and configure from command line. The second reason is that the software is put away from the standard directories so compiling new software becomes a different story. To handle this, you must add scripts to you compile process. 

# It is not for every use case.

Obviously, no solution is ideal for every use case, that is the reason threre are many solutions. When it comes to NixOS, the strength is that you can configure it with a few files and the system does the rest.

This is particularly useful if you want everything the same with many machines or instances. For cloud computing, you can get the correct configuration just by applying the old configuration file. 

# Advanced features

NixOS developers also claim many more advanced reasons for using it, but I honestly do not have the experience to judge if these are advantages.
