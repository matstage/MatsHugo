# NixOS 21.05 comes with GNOME40

When you activate GNOME in NixOS 21.05, the default version will be GNOME 4.0. This is great, it shows that the distribution is up to dat. 

# It does not compile!

The sad part for me is (was?) that the compile stopped on My i686 system. Did I expect it to be smooth, no. Using an i686 in this day and age, you must count on things not supporting it. I was a little dismayed though, it was also wuite tricky to find where it stopped.

# Compile everything else.

If you run into this, the best course of action is to compile another desktop. To troubleshoot it is better to have a running system to experiment on rather than trying to make the whole system run.
